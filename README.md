# Overview

This README will document the process of me learning kernel development and modifying the Linux kernel for the Raspberry Pi 5.

# Getting Started

First, I forked and added the [Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/Dishoungh/linux-rpi.git) as a submodule.

Now, install the Raspberry Pi Kernel Header files: `sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers`.
